CodeAlpha Internship Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the CodeAlpha internship tasks. This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed during my internship at CodeAlpha, a platform focused on providing hands-on software development experience. Each project showcases practical skills in Python programming, covering areas such as interactive applications, games, and financial tools.
About CodeAlpha
This repository includes the following Python projects:

Chatbot

Description: A simple command-line chatbot that responds to predefined user inputs with basic conversational phrases. It serves as an introductory project to user input handling and conditional logic in Python.
Features:
Responds to greetings like "hello" and "how are you."
Offers help with the phrase "can you help me."
Exits gracefully when the user types "bye."

Main File: chatbot.py


Hangman Game

Description: A classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting letters within a limited number of incorrect guesses.
Features:
Random word selection from a predefined list.
Displays the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters.
Tracks incorrect guesses with a limit of 6.
Validates user input to ensure single alphabetic characters.

Main File: hangman.py


Stock Portfolio Tracker

Description: A command-line tool to calculate the total value of a stock portfolio based on hardcoded stock prices and user-inputted share quantities. Optionally saves the portfolio summary to a text file.
Features:
Supports a predefined set of stocks (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT).
Calculates the total investment value based on user input.
Allows saving the portfolio summary to a file (portfolio_summary.txt).

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the projects in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:
random (standard library, no installation needed)
No external dependencies are required for these projects.



Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/poojagupta01/codealpha.git
cd codealpha


No additional dependencies are required, as all projects use Python’s standard library.


Usage
Each project is a standalone Python script. Navigate to the repository directory and run the desired script using Python.

Running the Chatbot:
python chatbot.py


Type phrases like "hello," "how are you," "can you help me," or "bye" to interact with the chatbot.


Running the Hangman Game:
python hangman.py


Enter one letter at a time to guess the hidden word. You have 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends.


Running the Stock Portfolio Tracker:
python "Stock Portfolio Tracker.py"


Enter stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) and quantities when prompted. Type "done" to finish input. Choose whether to save the summary to a file.
